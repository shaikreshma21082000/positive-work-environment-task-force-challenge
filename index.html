    <section>
       <h2>Abstract</h2>
       <p><i>W3C's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</i> defines accepted and acceptable behaviors and promotes
        high standards of professional practice. The goals of this code are to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Define acceptable and expected standards of behavior.</li>
            <li>Provide a benchmark.</li>
            <li>Ensure transparency in community and group management. </li>
            <li>Ensure an environment where people can participate without fear of harassment.</li>
            <li>Contribute to the identity of the organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is an unofficial proposal. Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/" > Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> for the operational version.</p>
        
        <article><h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>W3C is a growing and global community where participants choose to work together. W3C is committed to
            maintaining a positive working environment, where each participant feels appreciated and respected and
            where everyone adheres to the same high level of standards of personal behavior. In that process we
            experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment,
            misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally.
            </p>
        
        <p><i>W3C's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct </i>(CEPC) is useful to define accepted and acceptable
            behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. The goal of this code of conduct is to
            ensure that W3C is an environment where everyone can participate without fear of harassment. It also
            provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.
            </p>

        <p>The CEPC is complemented by a set of <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures"> Procedures</a>, applies to any member of the W3C community – staff,
            members, invited experts, and participants in W3C meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C mailing lists, code
            repositories, W3C conferences or W3C functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces
            legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.</p>

            <h2>Statement of Intent</h2>
            <p>
                W3C is committed to maintaining a <b>positive</b> work environment. This commitment calls for a workplace
            where participants at all levels behave according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept
            of this code is that we all share <i>responsibility</i> for our work environment.
            </p>
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <h4>Expected Behavior</h4>
            <p>Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and
                strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appreciate and accommodate our similarities and differences. We come from many cultures and
                        backgrounds, ways of life, and standards of behavior. Cultural differences can encompass everything
                        from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different
                        practices, attitudes, and beliefs. To help us achieve and maintain these high standards, each individual
                        participant is expected to share responsibility for our work environment by adhering to the behavioral
                        guidelines herein.
                        </li>
                    <li>Have empathy when discussing sensitive issues. Some participants may have experienced (or been
                        subjected to) various forms of violence in their lives, which may cause distress when they are
                        reminded of it. Avoid making jokes or callously mentioning sexual violence such as stalking or sexual
                        assault; in cases when the need arises to discuss these issues and how they affect people - do so with
                        tact and empathy taking into account the gravity of the situation, and make sure that participants are
                        appropriately warned in advance so they can choose to step out of these discussions.
                        </li>
                    <li>Treat everyone with respect. We are a large community of people who are passionate about our work,
                        sometimes holding strong opinions and beliefs. We are committed to dealing with each other with
                        courtesy, respect, and dignity at all times. Misunderstandings and disagreements do happen. When
                        conflicts arise, we are expected to resolve them maintaining that courtesy, respect, and dignity, even
                        when emotions are heightened.</li>
                    <li>Do not accept or engage in abusive behavior in any form, whether it is verbal, physical, sexual, or
                        implied.</li>
                    <li>Be honest. Be truthful, sincere, forthright and, unless professional duties require confidentiality or
                        special discretion, candid, straightforward, and frank.</li>
                    <li>Be inclusive and promote diversity. Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people
                        powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives
                        be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to
                        step back and encourage other voices to join in. Provide alternative ways to contribute.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be aware that displays of affection may complicate professional relationships. For some cultures,
                        overtly friendly disposition towards another participant involving body contact (e.g.: hugging,
                        touching on the arm or shoulder, or kissing) is uncommon and may be perceived as an invasion of
                        personal space, or as unwelcome advances.</li>
                    <li>Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory practices.</li>
                    <li>Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred names, titles (including pronouns), and
                        the appropriate tone of voice. Therefore, be formal and conservative in what you do and liberal in what
                        you accept from others and acknowledge the contributions of your peers.
                        </li>
                    <li>Accommodate participants' needs for physical distancing and other accommodations or precautions
                        due to health concerns such as immune deficiency, allergies, or chemical sensitivity.
                        </li>
                    <li>Be sensitive to language differences. English is the default language of the W3C. However, only some
                        of us are native English speakers. Many participants speak English as a second (or third) language.
                        People who communicate in non-native language often struggle to understand fast and/or quiet speech
                        and may speak louder than they usually would when communicating in their native tongue. If someone
                        struggles to express their thoughts, help ensure their ideas are adequately expressed, heard, and granted
                        thorough consideration.
                        </li>
                    <li>Respect confidentiality and privacy. Sometimes, matters we discuss may fall under various
                        <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#confidentiality-levels">confidentiality</a> agreements and strict adherence to these agreements is expected. In addition, certain
                        pieces of information disclosed in a group setting may be private in nature, or we may inadvertently
                        learn confidential information accidentally disclosed by other participants. Please exercise good
                        judgment, and make reasonable efforts to protect privacy and confidentiality of all participants.

            <h4 id="Unacceptable Behavior">Unacceptable Behavior</h4>
            <p><i>Unacceptable Behavior</i>run counter to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This list of
                unacceptable behaviors does not cover every case. Each person you interact with is unique, and behavior
                must be assessed on an individual level. Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your
                responsibility. W3C strictly prohibits discrimination, intimidation, harassment, and bullying of any kind and
                on any basis.
                </p>
                <p>Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and gender expression, sexual orientation,
                        disability (both visible and invisible), mental health, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race,
                        socio-economic status, ethnicity, caste, nationality, language, or religion</li>
                    <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to
                        food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
                        </li>
                    <li>Misgendering someone by deliberately referring to a person using the wrong pronouns or by using
                        someone's proper names or other terms that person has asked not to be used, also known as
                        deadnaming.</li>
                    <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they are not appropriate</li>
                    <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”)
                        without consent or after a request to stop.
                        </li>
                    <li>Threats of violence.</li>
                    <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to
                        engage in self-harm.
                        </li>
                    <li>Deliberate intimidation.                    </li>
                    <li>Stalking or physically following or invading someone's personal space after a request to stop.                    </li>
                    <li>Exposing others to contagious disease.</li>
                    <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>
                    <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
                    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.                    </li>
                    <li>Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy
                        with others.
                        </li>
                    <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease. </li>
                    <li>Deliberate outing of any aspect of a person’s gender identity without their consent</li>
                    <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent by the involved parties.</li>
                    <li>Use of coded language (also known as "dog whistles") used to rally support for hate groups or to
                        intimidate vulnerable groups.</li>
                    <li>Microaggressions, which are small comments or questions, either intentional or unintentional, that
                        marginalize people by communicating hostile, derogatory, or negative beliefs. Examples include:
                       <ul type="circle" >
                           <li>Patronizing language or behavior:</li>
                           <ul type="square">
                               <li>Be aware that, regardless of the speaker's intentions, some phrases or constructions lead
                                people to expect a patronizing statement to follow, and avoid such phrases. For example,
                                beginning an interjection with "Well, actually..." can set this expectation and be taken as a
                                sign of disrespect.
                                </li>
                               <li>Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need concepts defined or
                                explained to them. It’s great to be sensitive to the fact that people may not be familiar with
                                technical terms you use every day, but assuming that people are uninformed can come
                                across as patronizing.
                                </li>
                               <li>Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled (e.g., “So easy your
                                grandmother could do it”).
                                </li>
                           </ul>
                           <li>Repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else. </li>
                           <li>Feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic. </li>
                           <li>The use of racially charged language to describe an individual or thing (such as “thug” or
                            “ghetto”).</li>
                           <li>Referring to an individual in a way that demeans or challenges the validity of their racial
                            identity.</li>
                           <li>Mocking someone’s real or perceived accent or first language.</li>
                       </ul>
                        </li>
                    <li>Retaliating, or taking adverse action, against anyone who files a complaint that someone has violated
                        this code of conduct.</li>

            <h4>Safety versus Comfort</h4>
            <p>This Code prioritizes the safety of individuals, particularly those in marginalized communities, over the
                comfort of others, for example in situations involving:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Reverse" -isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia".</li>
                    <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not
                        discussing this with you”.</li>
                    <li>Communication in a tone you don’t find congenial.</li>
                    <li>Criticisms of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.</li>

            <h3>Reporting Violations and Supporting the Code</h3>
            <p>If you are concerned about your immediate safety, contact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emergency_telephone_numbers">local emergency services</a>. For a face to face event
                you may need to contact venue staff for assistance contacting emergency services.
                </p>
                <p>In most instances if you have an issue with someone’s behavior along the lines of this Code then please raise
                    it; there are a few potential people you could raise it to depending on your situation and your safety.
                    </p>
                <p>In most cases, issues are best resolved at the source. Accordingly, raising the issue with the group chair or
                    team contact of the relevant group is usually the best first place to raise an issue. Group chairs and team
                    contacts also have more of the context which helps them address the issue.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    You are welcome to raise issues directly with the Ombudspeople as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">group</a> or<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures"> individually</a>. All complaints
                    will be taken seriously and will receive a response.    
                </p>
                <p>If you are responsible for a community within the W3C such as in the role of a chair of a working group and
                    you witness harassment or any other behavior which goes against this code you are encouraged to address
                    the issue directly. If you need assistance, you might get assistance from an Ombudsperson or senior W3C
                    management.
                    </p>
                <p>Chairs, Team Contacts, and Event Organizers should take such immediate action as they deem necessary in
                    order to stop <a href="#Unacceptable Behavior">unacceptable behavior</a>. This action may take many forms, but examples may include:
                    </p>
                <h4>Immediately</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pointing out if someone is violating the CEPC to give them the chance to withdraw or edit their
                        statement</li>
                    <li>Reminding participants that meetings and work operate under the CEPC</li>
                    <li>Asking someone to leave a meeting or a conversation thread</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>After the Meeting</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Following up with affected participants, possibly in separate meetings</li>
                    <li>Reaching out to an Ombudsperson for assistance</li>
                    <li>Further information and resources for Chairs are available via the Chairs Training program</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>note </b> that the action must be directly related to stopping harm, and must be proportionate. People affected
                may request an Ombudsperson consider whether such actions are unacceptable under the terms of this Code.</p>

           <h3>If You've Done Something Improper</h3>
           <p>As we engage in diverse communities we may accidentally cause offense, whether through using
            unknowingly offensive terminology or through missing social cues.</p>
            <p>If you realize (or are told) that you have offended someone then take the appropriate steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Acknowledge that you've done something improper</li>
                <li>Briefly apologize. Don't try to explain yourself or minimize the issue</li>
                <li>. If possible, edit your message, restate your communication in a better way or withdraw your statement.
                    Publicly revising your statement helps define the culture for others</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Alice: “Yeah I used X and it was really crazy!” Eve: “Hey, could you not use that word? What about
                ‘ridiculous’ instead?” Alice: “oh sorry, sure.” -> edits old message to say “Yeah I used X and it was really
                confusing!”</p>
            <p>This will allow conversation to quickly continue without any need of further action or escalating the
                    situation.</p>
            <p>If you don't understand what you did wrong, assume that the hurt party has good cause and accept it. We
                cannot know everyone's background and should do our best to avoid harm. You are welcome to discuss it
                with a W3C<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures"> ombudsperson</a> later.</p>
