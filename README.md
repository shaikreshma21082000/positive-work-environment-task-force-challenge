# Positive Work Environment Task Force for World Wide Web Consortium

## Context
World Wide Web Consortium is a global community where participants choose to work together. In that community, participants experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, and in most cases can be resolved informally. The goals of this code are to:
- Define acceptable and expected standards of behavior.
- Provide a benchmark.
- Ensure transparency in community and group management.
- Ensure an environment where people can participate without fear of harassment.
- Contribute to the identity of the organization.

## Challenge
1. Being a developer you are assigned with the task of creating a document formulating all the Code of Work in the [PDF](./Positive-Work-Environment-at-W3C_Code-of-Ethics-and-Professional-Conduct.pdf) to be made it available on the Web.
2. One of the intention with the document is to make sure that the document is not just human readable but also machine readable. There are machines which can crawl for the new terms added to the glossary, the new sections added to the document, the last time the document was updated. So on and so forth.
